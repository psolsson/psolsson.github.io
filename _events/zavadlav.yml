title: "Multiscale Modeling with Machine Learning Potentials"
bio:  "Prof. Zavadlav obtained her Ph.D. in physics at the University of Ljubljana in 2015. She joined ETH Zurich in 2016 for her postdoc and received an ETH Postdoctoral Fellowship award a year later. In 2019, she was appointed as Assistant Professor for Multiscale Modeling of Fluid Materials at the Technical University of Munich. She was awarded with the ERC starting grant in 2022. Her research area is a combination of molecular modeling, multiscale simulations, and machine learning applied to complex phenomena ranging from life sciences to engineering. "
abstract: "Multiscale modeling is essential for understanding complex phenomena in fields ranging from life sciences to materials engineering. A prominent research area is the development of machine learning potentials (MLPs), particularly those based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which have emerged as a powerful tool for bridging the gap between quantum-mechanical accuracy and classical molecular dynamics efficiency. In this presentation, I will showcase the significant achievements of both atomistic and coarse-grained MLPs in effectively capturing many-body interactions. I will address the current challenges of MLP development, including the broad and accurate training dataset generation, capturing long-range interactions, and numerical stability. To address these challenges, we propose a range of innovative strategies that encompass novel training objectives, the synergistic integration of diverse data sources, physics-based GNN architectures, and advanced Bayesian methods for uncertainty quantification. Through insightful case studies of various molecular systems, I will demonstrate the practical effectiveness and versatility of our approaches. Lastly, I will introduce our software platform, chemtrain, designed to streamline the training of machine learning potentials with customizable routines and advanced training algorithms."
