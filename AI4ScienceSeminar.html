      <h1>Chalmers AI4Science Seminar</h1><br>
<p class="text-justify">Advances in machine learning and AI systems are increasingly influencing how we approach the
    quantitative sciences, including physics, chemistry, and biology. These opportunities include having machines learn
    new representations of interactions between particles, how matter transforms in reactions, help us decide what
    experiment to conduct next or detect emerging phenomena. Sparse data situations remain a significant hurdle in many
    sciences or situations where common data assumptions do not hold. Consequently, it remains critical to ground our
    efforts in the millennia of scientific insights embodied in the literature to avoid, in the best case, having
    machines relearn what we already know. The Chalmers AI4Science is a monthly seminar where we invite early-career
    researchers to present their work at the interface of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and a scientific
    discipline. This seminar series aims to provide an international platform at Chalmers for discussions about these
    topics and strengthen interdisciplinary research involving machine learning and AI at Chalmers. The Chalmers
    AI4Science seminar is organized by Simon Olsson and Roc√≠o Mercado.

        <h2>Generative Sequence-Based Approaches to Protein Design</h2><br>
        <strong>Sarah Alamdari (Microsoft Research)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>Engineered proteins play increasingly essential roles in applications spanning pharmaceuticals, molecular tools, synthetic biology, and more. Deep generative models present an opportunity to accelerate protein engineering for therapeutic and biological applications. Recent advances in protein language models, has facilitated more controllable and flexible approaches to protein design.</p>
<p>In this talk I will cover our recent work in developing these general-purpose protein language models and exploring their capabilities for functional protein design. First, we will discuss a general-purpose diffusion framework, EvoDiff, that combines evolutionary-scale data with the distinct conditioning capabilities of diffusion models for controllable protein design. Next, we introduce an extension of this work titled Dayhoff, a generative model of proteins that combines single sequences and sequence alignments into one autoregressive model via long context lengths. In this work, we explore how model size, data quality, and diversity impact gains in protein expression. We envision that these modeling frameworks will enable new capabilities in protein engineering towards programmable, functional design.</p>

        <p class="text-justify"><p>Sarah Alamdari is currently a Senior Applied Scientist at Microsoft Research New England, in the Biomedical Machine Learning Group. Here, she uses artificial intelligence to design new proteins, with the goal of advancing our understanding biology. Her recent work has focused on developing new protein language models, employing machine learning techniques on protein sequence datasets. Previously, she completed her PhD in Chemical Engineering at the University of Washington as an NSF graduate research fellow where she applied and developed molecular dynamic frameworks to study the behavior of biomolecules at complex interfaces.</p>

        <h2>Multiscale Modeling with Machine Learning Potentials</h2><br>
        <strong>Julija Zavadlav (TUM)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>Multiscale modeling is essential for understanding complex phenomena in fields ranging from life sciences to materials engineering. A prominent research area is the development of machine learning potentials (MLPs), particularly those based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which have emerged as a powerful tool for bridging the gap between quantum-mechanical accuracy and classical molecular dynamics efficiency. In this presentation, I will showcase the significant achievements of both atomistic and coarse-grained MLPs in effectively capturing many-body interactions. I will address the current challenges of MLP development, including the broad and accurate training dataset generation, capturing long-range interactions, and numerical stability. To address these challenges, we propose a range of innovative strategies that encompass novel training objectives, the synergistic integration of diverse data sources, physics-based GNN architectures, and advanced Bayesian methods for uncertainty quantification. Through insightful case studies of various molecular systems, I will demonstrate the practical effectiveness and versatility of our approaches. Lastly, I will introduce our software platform, chemtrain, designed to streamline the training of machine learning potentials with customizable routines and advanced training algorithms.</p>

Her research area is a combination of molecular modeling, multiscale simulations, and machine learning applied to complex phenomena ranging from life sciences to engineering.</p>

        <h2>Explaining and controlling turbulent flows through deep learning</h2><br>
        <strong>Ricardo Vinuesa (KTH)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>In this presentation we first use a framework for deep-learning explainability to identify the most important Reynolds-stress (Q) events in a turbulent channel (simulated via DNS) and a turbulent boundary layer (obtained experimentally). This objective way to assess importance reveals that the most important Q events are not the ones with the highest Reynolds shear stress. This framework is also used to identify completely new coherent structures, and we find that the most important coherent regions in the flow only have an overlap of 70% with the classical Q events. In the second part of the presentation we use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to discover completely new strategies of active flow control. We show that DRL applied to a blowing-and-suction scheme significantly outperforms the classical opposition control in a turbulent channel: while the former yields 30% drag reduction, the latter only 20%. We conclude that DRL has tremendous potential for drag reduction in a wide range of complex turbulent-flow configurations.</p>

        <h2>Unexpected Lessons from Neural Networks Built with Symmetry for Physical Systems</h2><br>
        <strong>Tess E. Smidt (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>Atomic systems (molecules, crystals, proteins, etc.) are naturally represented by a set of coordinates in 3D space labeled by atom type. This is a challenging representation to use for machine learning because the coordinates are sensitive to 3D rotations, translations, and inversions (the symmetries of 3D Euclidean space). In this talk I‚Äôll give an overview of Euclidean invariance and equivariance in machine learning for atomic systems. Then, I‚Äôll share some recent applications of these methods on a variety of atomistic modeling tasks (ab initio molecular dynamics, prediction of crystal properties, and scaling of electron density predictions). Finally, I‚Äôll explore open questions in expressivity, data-efficiency, and trainability of methods leveraging invariance and equivariance.</p>

Tess earned her SB in Physics from MIT in 2012 and her PhD in Physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 2018.

Prior to joining the MIT EECS faculty, she was the 2018 Alvarez Postdoctoral Fellow in Computing Sciences at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a Software Engineering Intern on the Google Accelerated Sciences team where she developed Euclidean symmetry equivariant neural networks which naturally handle 3D geometry and geometric tensor data.</p>

        <h2>Exploiting symmetries in machine learning models</h2><br>
        <strong>Soledad Villar (Johns Hopkins University)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>Any representation of data involves arbitrary investigator choices. Because those choices are external to the data-generating process, each choice leads to an exact symmetry, corresponding to the group of transformations that takes one possible representation to another. These are the passive symmetries; they include coordinate freedom, gauge symmetry and units covariance, all of which have led to important results in physics. Our goal is to understand the implications of passive symmetries for machine learning: Which passive symmetries play a role (e.g., permutation symmetry in graph neural networks)? What are dos and don‚Äôts in machine learning practice? We assay conditions under which passive symmetries can be implemented as group equivariances. We also discuss links to causal modeling, and argue that the implementation of passive symmetries is particularly valuable when the goal of the learning problem is to generalize out of sample.</p>

        <h2>AI4Science at Microsoft Research</h2><br>
        <strong>Rianne van den Berg (Microsoft Research)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>In July 2022 Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/ai4science-to-empower-the-fifth-paradigm-of-scientific-discovery/">announced</a> a new global team in Microsoft Research, spanning the UK, China and the Netherlands, to focus on AI for science. In September 2022 we announced that we have also opened a new lab in Berlin, Germany. In this talk I will first discuss the research areas that we are currently exploring in AI4Science at Microsoft Research in Cambridge (UK), Amsterdam and in our new lab in Berlin, covering topics such as drug discovery, material generation, neural PDE solvers, electronic structure theory and computational catalysis. Then I will dive a little deeper into our recent work on Clifford Neural layers for PDE modeling. The PDEs of many physical processes describe the evolution of scalar and vector fields. In order to take into account the correlation between these different fields and their internal components, we represent these fields as multivectors, which consist of scalar, vector, as well as higher-order components. Their algebraic properties, such as multiplication, addition and other arithmetic operations can be described by Clifford algebras, which we use to design Clifford convolutions and Clifford Fourier transforms. We empirically evaluate the benefit of Clifford neural layers by replacing convolution and Fourier operations in common neural PDE surrogates by their Clifford counterparts on two-dimensional Navier-Stokes and weather modeling tasks, as well as three-dimensional Maxwell equations. If time permits I will briefly cover very recent work on protein structure prediction and coarse graining molecular dynamics.</p>

        <h2>Can machine learning replace ADME experiments in drug discovery?</h2><br>
        <strong>Raquel Rodriguez Perez (Novartis)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties play an important role in the success of drug candidates. Unfavorable pharmacokinetics (PK) can prevent that compounds progress in drug development and early ADME/PK properties‚Äô screening aims at reducing the number of molecules failing in the development process. This talk will focus on how to use machine learning to leverage historical ADME/PK data and make predictions for new compounds. Machine learning models developed for PK property predictions will be presented, as well as some of their applications at NIBR. Such models are applicable to large libraries, virtual compounds, and generative chemistry workflows. Hence, predictions enable early informed decisions and compound prioritization, aiming at reducing late-stage attrition. However, using machine learning-based predictions to support decision-making in a drug discovery project involves important considerations. Current challenges and future directions for improving the use of ADMET models in industry will be discussed.</p>

        <h2>Artificial Chemical Intelligence: Integrated Theory, Simulations and AI for Enabling Molecular Discovery</h2><br>
        <strong>Pratyush Tiwary (University of Maryland, College Park)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>The universality of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics has led to a language comprehensible to chemists, physicists, materials scientists, geologists &amp; others, enabling countless scientific discoveries in diverse fields. In the last decade, a new arguably common language that everyone seems to speak but no one quite fully understands, has emerged with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). It is natural to ask if AI can be integrated with the various theoretical and simulation methods rooted in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics for discoveries that none of these could achieve individually. It is also natural to ask if chemists, who are not fundamentally trained in AI, should trust any of the results obtained using AI or even worse, theory or computer simulations that were guided by AI. In this seminar I will show how such an integration of disciplines can be attained, creating trustable, robust AI frameworks for use by chemists and physical scientists. I will talk about such methods developed by my group using and extending different flavors of AI [1-3]. I will demonstrate the methods on different problems involving protein kinases, riboswitches and amino acid nucleation [4-5], where we predict mechanisms at timescales much longer than milliseconds while keeping all-atom/femtosecond resolution, including the problem of recovering a Boltzmann weighted ensemble of conformations from AlphaFold2 [6]. I will conclude with an outlook for future challenges and opportunities, envisioning a new sub-discipline of ‚ÄúArtificial Chemical Intelligence‚Äù where chemistry (both theory and simulations) move hand-in-hand with AI to enable smart molecular discovery.<br /> [1] Wang, Ribeiro, Tiwary.

        <h2>Supervised and physics-informed learning in function spaces</h2><br>
        <strong>Paris Perdikaris (University of Pennsylvania)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>While the great success of modern deep learning lies in its ability to approximate maps between finite-dimensional vector spaces, many tasks in science and engineering involve continuous measurements that are functional in nature. For example, in climate modeling one might wish to predict the pressure field over the earth from measurements of the surface air temperature field. The goal is then to learn an operator, between the space of temperature functions to the space of pressure functions. In recent years, operator learning techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for supervised learning in infinite-dimensional function spaces. In this talk we will provide an introduction to this topic, present a general approximation framework for operators, and demonstrate how one can construct deep learning models that can handle functional data. We will see how such tools can help us build neural ODE and PDE solvers that can be trained even in the absence of labeled data, and enable the fast prediction of continuous spatio-temporal fields up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to conventional numerical solvers. We will also discuss key open questions related to generalization, data-efficiency and inductive bias, the resolution of which is critical for the success of AI in science and engineering.</p>

        <h2>Kernel Methods for Koopman-based Modeling in Molecular Simulation</h2><br>
        <strong>Feliks N√ºske (MPI Magdeburg)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>Koopman operator theory, and its main algorithm extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD), has emerged as a powerful modeling approach for complex dynamical systems arising in physics, chemistry, materials science, and engineering. The basic idea is to leverage existing simulation data to learn a linear model that allows to predict expectation values of observable functions at future times. Though the algorithm is conceptually quite simple, its underlying mathematical structure is very rich, and can be used for different purposes including control, coarse graining, or the identification of metastable states in complex molecules and materials.</p>
<p>The success of the method depends critically on the choice of finite-dimensional subspace (called dictionary), which reflects a priori knowledge of the system. Here, kernel methods emerge as very useful, since they allow using a rich dictionary defined implicitly by the data. On the other hand, the application of kernel methods typically leads to large linear algebra problems that can be challenging to solve in practice.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In this talk, I will present recent results on the efficient use of kernel-based EDMD in the context of molecular simulation. I will first introduce the general Koopman framework and the associated variational formulation for metastable systems. Then, I will show how to introduce kernels in this context. Finally, I will show how low-rank approximations based on random Fourier features (RFFs) can be used to solve the resulting linear algebra problems efficiently.</p>

        <h2>Controlling Diffusion Models at Inference Time</h2><br>
        <strong>Kirill Neklyudov (MILA and Universit√© de Montr√©al)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>Kirill Neklyudov is an Assistant Professor at the University of Montreal and a Core Academic Member at Mila - Quebec AI Institute developing novel methods in generative modelling, Monte Carlo methods, Optimal Transport, and applying those to solve fundamental problems in natural sciences, e.g. finding eigenstates of the many-body Schrodinger equation, simulating molecular dynamics, predicting the development of biological cells, conformational sampling, and protein folding. Previously, he did two postdocs: at Vector Institute with Al√°n Aspuru-Guzik and Alireza Makhzani; at the University of Amsterdam with Max Welling.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="text-justify"><p>The classical paradigm of generative modeling, as the problem of reproducing the training data distribution, becomes less relevant for many applications, including drug discovery and text-to-image generation. In practice, generative models demonstrate the best performance when tailored to specific needs at inference time. I will present two novel approaches that allow the control of the distributions of generated samples at inference time. Superposition of Diffusion Models (SuperDiff) combines pretrained diffusion models to sample from a mixture of distributions (logical OR) or to generate samples that are likely under all models (logical AND). SuperDiff leverages a new scalable It√¥ density estimator for the log-likelihood of the diffusion SDE, which incurs no additional overhead compared to the well-known Hutchinson‚Äôs estimator needed for divergence calculations. In the second half of the talk, I will present an efficient and principled method for sampling from a sequence of annealed, geometric-averaged, or product distributions derived from pretrained score-based models. We derive a weighted simulation scheme, which we call Feynman-Kac Correctors (FKCs), based on the celebrated Feynman-Kac formula by carefully accounting for terms in the appropriate partial differential equations (PDEs). Finally, I‚Äôll demonstrate different applications of these methods, varying from the classical image generation tasks to molecule design and sampling from Boltzmann densities.</p>

        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>AlphaFold2 revolutionized structural biology by accurately predicting protein structures from sequence. Its implementation however (i) lacks the code and data required to train models for new tasks, such as predicting alternate protein conformations or antibody structures, (ii) is unoptimized for commercially available computing hardware, making large-scale prediction campaigns impractical, and (iii) remains poorly understood with respect to how training data and regimen influence accuracy. Here we report OpenFold, an optimized and trainable version of AlphaFold2. We train OpenFold from scratch and demonstrate that it fully reproduces AlphaFold2‚Äôs accuracy. By analyzing OpenFold training, we find new relationships between data size/diversity and prediction accuracy and gain insights into how OpenFold learns to fold proteins during its training process.</p>

However, protein datasets contain information in addition to sequence that can improve model performance. This talk will cover pretrained models that use both sequence and structural data, their application to predict which portions of proteins can be removed while retaining function, and a new set of protein fitness benchmarks to measure progress in pretrained models of proteins.</p>

        <h2>Simulations and machine learning for molecular design and reactivity</h2><br>
        <strong>Kjell Jorner (ETH Z√ºrich)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>Machine learning represents an exciting opportunity to accelerate discovery in the chemical sciences, and to shorten the time from discovery to products. However, the available (experimental) data for chemistry is often limited, and it is not equally distributed in the vast ‚Äòchemical space‚Äô. Our approach is try to bridge this gap by relying on a combination of machine learning and physical simulation. In the first part of the talk, I will describe our work in the field of molecular design for organic electronic materials. Many molecular design algorithms rely on machine learning models to predict the properties of a molecule for a certain application. Although ML models often work well on similar molecules as they were trained on, they often break down when generalizing to different parts of the chemical space. Generative models then abuse these weaknesses of the propery predictor and start generating false positives. We have therefore spent time to develop a series of very fast physics-based property predictors for important properties of organic electronic materials. These can then be coupled with high-throughput virtual screening or molecular design models to discovery new promising candidates. An alternative is to work in a constrained fragment space, which ensures that machine learning methods are sufficiently generalizable. We will give examples for such as fragment-constrained optimization of singlet fission materials using genetic algorithms which are steered by prediction uncertainty. In the second part of the talk, I will present our work in the area of reaction prediction, using a combination of quantum-chemical models and machine learning. Also here, we have developed fast physics-based property predictors for chemical reactivity that we use in generative models, including the first benchmark task for chemical reaction design. Using these simulations methods, we also generate large reactivity datasets on which deep learning models can be trained.</p>

        <h2>Why machine learning can find a new material but not a needle in a haystack.</h2><br>
        <strong>Kevin Jablonka (University of Jena, Germany)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>The space of possible materials is unimaginably large. To find our way in this space, having a map that can guide us would be nice. In this presentation, we show that machine learning can provide us with such a map [1]. We can use machine learning to encode patterns that are tacit or hidden in a large number of dimensions of this chemical space, and then use it to guide the design of materials. The simplest application of this navigation system is to predict properties that are hard to predict with conventional quantum chemistry or molecular simulation alone [2, 3]. Once we have this in place, we can use it to most efficiently gather information about structure-property-function relationships. A fundamental difficulty here is, however, that we often have to deal with multiple, often competing objectives. For instance, increasing the reactivity often decreases the selectivity. Interestingly, one can show that using a geometric construction, one can also effectively, and without bias, use machine learning to dramatically accelerate materials design and discovery in such a multiobjective design space [4].It is important to realize, however, that machine learning relies on data that a machine can use [5]. Toward this goal, we need to develop infrastructure to allow for the capture without overhead while providing chemists with tools that simplify their daily work [4, 5]. A challenge, however, is that data typically cannot be easily collected in this nice tabular firm. Recent advantages of applying large language models (LLMs) to chemistry indicate that they might be used to address this challenge. I will showcase how LLMs can autonomously use tools, leverage structured data as well as soft inductive biases, and, in this way, transform how we model chemistry. [6, 7].</p>

        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is fueling computer-aided drug discovery. Chemical language models (CLMs) constitute a recent addition to the medicinal chemist‚Äôs toolkit for AI-driven drug design. CLMs can be used to generate novel molecules in the form of strings (e.g., SMILES, SELFIES) without relying on human-engineered molecular assembly rules. By taking inspiration from natural language processing, CLMs have shown able to learn ‚Äúsyntax‚Äù rules for molecule generation, and to implicitly capture ‚Äúsemantic‚Äù molecular features, such as physicochemical properties, bioactivity, and chemical synthesizability. This talk will illustrate some successful applications of CLMs to design novel bioactive compounds from scratch in the context of drug discovery, at the interface between theory and wet-lab experiments.

        <h2>Merging physics-based simulations and machine learning to predict rare molecular conformations and find them in experimental data.</h2><br>
        <strong>Roberto Covino (Frankfurt)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>Biomolecules are highly dynamic systems. They reorganize between a network of conformations connected by rare structural intermediates, which is referred to as their conformational ensemble. The ensemble, including the rare intermediate structures, determines biomolecular function in the cell. However, mapping biomolecular conformational ensembles is still challenging in computational and experimental approaches. Computer simulations are the modern manifestation of scientific theories and, merged with machine learning, can help us overcome challenges in the biomolecular sciences. In the first part of my talk, I will illustrate our work to integrate path sampling with machine learning to empower our ability to simulate rare conformational transitions. Our algorithm provides efficient sampling, mechanism, thermodynamic, and kinetic information of rare molecular events at a moderate computational cost. In the second part, I will discuss using simulation-based inference to identify biomolecular conformations in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data. cryoEM is a powerful paradigm for characterizing protein conformational ensembles. However, even though the frozen sample contains information on the entire ensemble, accurately identifying rare or disordered molecular conformations depicted in a single cryoEM image is still challenging. We integrated physics-based simulations, Bayesian inference, and deep learning to develop the cryoEM simulation-based inference (cryoSBI) framework for inferring molecular conformations and their uncertainties from individual cryoEM images. We validated cryoSBI on synthetic and experimental data. Our approach paves the way to characterizing entire conformational ensembles from experimental data.</p>

        <h2>How data-driven studies translate into chemical and physical principles</h2><br>
        <strong>Rose Cersonsky (University of Wisconsin-Madison)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have transformed computational chemistry and materials research. In ML algorithms, we rely on machine-learning representations to serve as a ‚Äòmathematical proxy‚Äô for our underlying chemistry. Molecular featurization‚Äîhow we transform atoms and molecules into mathematical signals appropriate for machine-learning thermodynamic quantities‚Äîhas an important role in our ability to learn material properties and observable quantities.  There are many ways to encode raw chemical data, notably string-based representations such as SMILES or SELFIES, and the suitable choice largely depends on the problem at hand and the architecture of our models. However, in thermodynamic contexts, where the chemistry and connectivity remain largely unchanged, such as in molecular simulation, it is more typical to use configuration-dependent features, which transform molecular coordinates into a range of suitable numerical representations. In this talk, I will primarily focus on how we assess and interpret models built on such molecular representations, focusing on how to do so using shallow, simple machine-learning models. I‚Äôll first start on the idea of thermodynamic fingerprints as order parameters for complex phenomena, contrasting technologies built through the machine-learning potentials community with traditional analyses, as well as extending these ideas into new methods for bottom-up coarse-graining. From here, I will focus on how to extract actionable chemical and physical principles from models built on chemical data, a task traditionally achieved through unsupervised analyses such as principal components analysis or t-stochastic neighborhood embeddings. However, these methods only ask, ‚ÄòWhat makes these data points similar?‚Äô not ‚ÄòIn what ways does my model see these points as similar?‚Äô The latter question, particularly in the context of supervised ML models, is more powerful and informative for structure-property relationships. Our results show that this multi-objective framing, with its inherent interpretability, reveals underlying trends across many ML tasks, from materials classification to machine-learning potential building to non-linear regression tasks.</p>

        <h2>Predicting interaction partners and generating new protein sequences using protein language models</h2><br>
        <strong>Anne-Florence Bitbol (EPFL)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>Protein sequences are shaped by functional optimization on the one hand and by evolutionary history, i.e. phylogeny, on the other hand. A multiple sequence alignment of homologous proteins contains sequences which evolved from the same ancestral sequence and have similar structure and function. In such an alignment, statistical patterns in amino-acid usage at different sites encode structural and functional constraints. Protein language models trained on multiple sequence alignments capture coevolution between sites and structural contacts, but also phylogenetic relationships. I will discuss a method we recently proposed that leverages these models to predict which proteins interact among the paralogs of two protein families, and improves the prediction of the structure of some protein complexes. Next, I will show that these models can be used to generate new protein sequences from given protein families. While multiple sequence alignments are very useful, their construction is imperfect. To address these limitations, we developed ProtMamba, a homology-aware but alignment-free protein language model based on the Mamba architecture, which efficiently uses long contexts. I will show that ProtMamba has promising generative properties, and is able to predict fitness.</p>

        <h2>Data-driven discovery of coordinates and governing equations</h2><br>
        <strong>Bethany A Lusch (Argonne National Lab)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>Governing equations are essential to the study of physical systems, providing models that can generalize to predict previously unseen behaviors. There are many systems of interest across disciplines where large quantities of data have been collected, but the underlying governing equations remain unknown. This work introduces an approach to discover governing models from data. The proposed method addresses a key limitation of prior approaches by simultaneously discovering coordinates that admit a parsimonious dynamical model. Developing parsimonious and interpretable governing models has the potential to transform our understanding of complex systems, including in neuroscience, biology, and climate science.</p>

        <h2>Free-energy Calculations from Neural Thermodynamic Integration</h2><br>
        <strong>Tristan Bereau (Uni. Heidelberg)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>Thermodynamic integration (TI) offers a rigorous method for estimating free-energy differences by integrating over a sequence of interpolating conformational ensembles. However, TI calculations are computationally expensive and typically limited to coupling a small number of degrees of freedom due to the need to sample numerous intermediate ensembles with sufficient conformational-space overlap. We propose to perform TI along an alchemical pathway represented by a trainable neural network, which we term Neural TI. Critically, we parametrize a time-dependent Hamiltonian interpolating between the interacting and non-interacting systems, and optimize its gradient using a denoising-diffusion objective. The ability of the resulting energy-based diffusion model to sample all intermediate ensembles allows us to perform TI from a single reference calculation. We apply our method to Lennard-Jones fluids, where we report accurate calculations of the excess chemical potential, demonstrating that Neural TI is capable of coupling hundreds of degrees of freedom at once. Extensions to solvation free energies for atomistic systems will be discussed.</p>

        <h2>Causal Experimental Design</h2><br>
        <strong>Stefan Bauer (Helmholtz Munich / TU Munich / CIFAR)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>Deep neural networks have achieved outstanding success in many tasks ranging from computer vision, to natural language processing, and robotics. However such models still pale in their ability to understand the world around us, as well as generalizing and adapting to new tasks or environments. One possible solution to this problem are causal models, since they can reason about the connections between causal variables and the effect of intervening on them. This talk will introduce the fundamental  concepts of causal inference, connections and synergies with deep learning  as well as practical applications and advances in sustainability and AI for science.</p>

        <strong>Bastian Rieck (Helmholtz Pioneer Campus and Technical University of Munich)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>With novel measurement technologies easily resulting in a deluge of data, we need to consider multiple perspectives in order to ‚Äòsee the forest for the trees.‚Äô A single perspective or scale is often insufficient to faithfully capture the underlying patterns of complex phenomena, in particular in the life sciences. However, moving from an ‚Äòeither‚Äìor‚Äô selection of relevant scales to a ‚Äòboth‚Äìand‚Äô utilisation of all scales promises better insights and improved expressivity. The emerging field of topological machine learning provides us with effective tools for building multi-scale representations of complex data. This talk presents two use cases that demonstrate the power of learning such representations. The first use case involves improving antimicrobial resistance prediction‚Äîa critical problem in a world suffering from superbugs‚Äîwhile the second use case permits us a glimpse into how cognition changes from early childhood to adolescence.</p>

        <h2>Proteins under the computational microscope: from machine learning to molecular simulations</h2><br>
        <strong>Antonia Mey (University of Edinburgh)</strong><br>
        <p class="text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b><p>Proteins are molecular machines that drive most biological processes. Understanding how proteins function and how they interact with other molecules is essential for us to comprehend life and also aids in regulating diseases. One way to regulate protein function is through small molecules that interact with proteins to inhibit their activity. However, discovering new molecules and efficient methods to predict how effectively they may bind to a target protein is a challenging task. Harnessing computational tools, using machine learning and molecular simulations, provides atomistic models for studying the interactions between a small molecule and a protein. To make computational models valuable, they need to have a predictive power such as proposing a ligand pose, typically done by docking algorithms, or a free energy of binding, often done through so called alchemical free energy calculations. In this talk, I will walk you through our process of creating new molecules from x-ray fragment hits [1] using a generative machine learning model looking at the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. I will also highlight two different ways in which we can assess the free energy of binding: through machine learning [2] and alchemical free energy calculations [3], where we will look at protein examples involved in cancers and antimicrobial resistance.
