speaker: "Roberto Covino (Frankfurt)"
title: "tbc"
bio:  "Roberto Covino is W3 Professor of Computational Life Science at the Institute of Computer Science at Goethe University Frankfurt, and a Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies. His research uses theory, simulation, and machine learning to understand how biomolecular functions emerge from the interplay between structure, dynamics, and complexity. He focuses on understanding the mechanism of key events in proteins and cellular membranes. His research interests range from molecular biophysics to statistical modelling, machine learning, lipid and protein biochemistry. RC studied physics and theoretical physics at the University of Bologna and obtained his PhD in physics at the University of Trento. He then worked as post-doctoral scientistic at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics. RC was appointed Professor of AI in Protein Science at Bayreuth University in 2023 and received the call to Goethe University in 2024."
