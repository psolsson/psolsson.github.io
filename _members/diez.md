description: "Juan works on deep generative models for sampling of 3D configurations of small, drug-like molecules, and molecular property prediction (Industry advisors: Ola Engkvist and Atanas Patronov). Before starting as a PhD student, Juan worked in the group as a MSc student with Sara to build deep generative models for molecular design with desired property profiles and 3D conformer distributions. That project was co-supervised by Dr. Rocío Mercado (AstraZeneca)."
