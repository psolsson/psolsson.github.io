Acknowledged for their contributions, Dr. Lotfollahi has received multiple awards, as evidenced by their exemplary achievements. Their work has been highlighted in various press and journals, showcasing the impact of their research. Dr. Lotfollahi has also garnered numerous fellowships, grants, and scholarships, including prestigious ones from Joachim Hertz, EMBL, and Meta.
Beyond academic pursuits, Dr. Lotfollahi has served as a researcher, consultant, and advisor in biotechnology and ML/AI companies such as Cellarity, Meta AI, SANTA ANA Bio, and Relation Therapeutics."
abstract: "The field of cellular biology has long sought to understand the intricate mechanisms that govern cellular responses to various perturbations, be they chemical, physical, or biological. Traditional experimental approaches, while invaluable, often face limitations in scalability and throughput, especially when exploring the vast combinatorial space of potential cellular states. Enter generative machine learning that has shown exceptional promise in modelling complex biological systems. This talk will highlight recent successes, address the challenges and limitations of current models, and discuss the future direction of this exciting interdisciplinary field. Through examples of practical applications, we will illustrate the transformative potential of generative ML in advancing our understanding of cellular perturbations and in shaping the future of biomedical research."
