description: "<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Research group at Chalmers University developing machine learning models to accelerate molecular simulations, molecular dynamics, vaccine design, drug design and materials design. Lead by Simon Olsson, pioneer in AI for Molecular Simulation.\">
<p>The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Natural Sciences (AIMLeNS), based at the Data Science and AI division of the Computer Science and Engineering department at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. <br> In the AIMLeNS lab, we are broadly interested in the interface of AI and Machine learning to the Natural Sciences. </p>
Currently, our main research areas are: 
<br> 
<ol> 
<li><b>AI and molecular simulations:</b> We are particularly interested in GenAI surrogates to bridge to experimentally observable time-scales.</li> 
<li><b>Generative AI in inverse molecular design:</b> including design of small-molecule therapeutics, biologics, vaccines, and antibodies.</li> 
</ol>
<p>We're a tight-knit team of computer scientists, chemists, physicists, and mathematicians working collaboratively. Our focus is on developing practical methods that blend traditional disciplines with modern machine learning and AI technologies to effectively address large-scale problems.</p>
