description: "Simon was an undergraduate researcher at [University of Copenhagen](http://www.ku.dk) with the late [Flemming M. Poulsen](https://publons.com/researcher/2834313/flemming-m-poulsen/) working on protein folding and NMR Spectroscopy in [SBiN Lab](https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/research/bms/sbinlab/). He continued his MSc research in [SBiN Lab](https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/research/bms/sbinlab/) with [Kaare Telium](https://twitter.com/KTeilum) working on ensemble modeling and NMR spectroscopy of the intrinsically disordered peptide IAPP.


Simon moved on to do a PhD with [Thomas Hamelryck](https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/271052) in statistical bioinformatics with applications in structural biology at [SCARB](https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/research/scarb/). 


In 2014, Simon was awarded an [independent postdoctoral fellowship from the Danish Council for Independent Research](https://ufm.dk/forskning-og-innovation/tilskud-til-forskning-og-innovation/hvem-har-modtaget-tilskud/2014/postdoc-bevillinger-fra-det-frie-forskningsrad-natur-og-univers-11-februar-2014) to move to  Switzerland and take up a postdoc with [Andrea Cavalli](https://www.irb.usi.ch/computational-structural-biology/) and [Roland Riek](https://bionmr.ethz.ch/) jointly at the IRB in Bellinzona and ETH Zurich. Here, Simon worked on developing methods for combining experimental biophysical data with molecular simulations.


In 2016, Simon was awarded the [DRS postdoctoral fellowship](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/sites/drs/postdocs/drs_fellowships/index.html) and an [Alexander von Humboldt postdoctoral fellowship](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/) to join [Frank No√©](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/comp-mol-bio/index.html) at FU Berlin to work on integrative methods for structural biology and artificial intelligence methods for the sciences.


Since October 2020, Simon is a [WASP AI-MLX Professor](http://www.wasp-sweden.org/) for Artificial Intelligence in the Natural Sciences, at [Chalmers](http://www.chalmers.se), where he leads the Artificial Intelligence in the Natural Sciences (AIMLeNS) group.
